## Hiragana and Katakana Trainer

#### Background
Around 2014 ~ 2015, several of my friends were learning Japanese and were preparing for the JLPT N1, N2 exams.
At that time the language learning apps such as Duolingo were not as popular and advanced as they are today and they needed something that exclusively focuses on the
Hiragana and Katakana training and can can run on desktop computers while they do their reading, exercise, and notes.
We searched and tried multiple learning software like the Rosetta Stone, they were either "too powerful" that exceeded the needs or lacked certain features we wanted.
So I decided to make my own.

#### How to Use
- Download the zipped package `Japanese.Hiragana.and.Katakana.Trainer.7z` from the v1.0.0 release, extract all the files and run the `Japanese Syllabary Trainer.jar`.
- The `voice` directory and the `settings.ini` have to be placed within the same directory as the `jar` file.

#### Known Issues
- Few Dakuon/Combos might be missing their voice files.

#### Future of This Project
- I'm in the middle of making a newer version of this tool in C#.
- This Java version will likely not receive any major updates anymore besides small fixes like adding missing voice files.
